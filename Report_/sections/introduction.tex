\section{Introduction}

* introduce the problem, its significance, how we intended to solve it

Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is the most widely played casino game in the world, largely due to its simple game structure in which a player attempts to get the highest score by drawing cards from a deck. The probabilistic nature of Blackjack leads to 

Whilst an optimum strategy for blackjack has been known by statisticians for decades by drawing on the expected value of future cards \cite{Baldwin01091956}, training an intelligent agent to learn the optimum strategy is an approach not as often taken. Reinforcement learning is the subfield of machine learning which aims to train an agent in an environment based on a reward, so that an optimum 'policy' can be obtained.

There are many variations to the game, but for the purposes of this project, the sequence of play was as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A card is dealt to the player with value \(C_1\).
    \item For \(n\) iterations, or until a total score of 21 is exceeded, the player can make one of two choices;
    \begin{enumerate} 
        \item Stick, and end the game.
        \item Hit, and receive another card with value \(C_{n+1}\).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The final score is calculated using
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Score} = 
            \begin{cases}
                (\sum C_n)^2 & \text{if } \sum C_n \le 21\\
                0            & \text{if } \sum C_n >   21\\
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

* describe the two situations

Optimal strategies have been developed for varieties of game play, with 

To approach this challenge, two situations were considered, where 'infinite' describes the 

This paper details the methodology taken for both problem situations, the result of each in context of an optimal result, and a conclusion on the \_\_\_\_.
