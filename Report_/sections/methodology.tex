\section{Methodology}



In training an agent to play Blackjack, an iterative Q-Learning approach has been taken. Q-Learning aims to learn the optimal 'q-value' for given state-action pairs in an environment, i.e., the respective value of making a certain move in a certain environmental state. ... further description

This approach was selected because it does not require direct 


\begin{multline}
    Q_{new}(s,a)=Q_{old}(s,a)+\overbrace{\alpha}^{\mathclap{\text{Learning Rate}}}(R(s,a)+\\ \underbrace{\gamma}_{\mathclap{\text{Discount rate}}}MaxQ(s',a')+Q_{old}(s,a))
\end{multline}
